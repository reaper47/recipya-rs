## Warning

The [Recipya](https://github.com/reaper47/recipya) project is currently being rewritten in Go as announced [here](https://github.com/reaper47/recipya/discussions/422). The Rust project is not ready for production nor to selfhost. 
The user interface should look exactly the same as the original. 

## Introduction

A clean, simple and powerful recipe manager web application for unforgettable family recipes, empowering you to curate and share your favorite recipes.
It is focused on simplicity for the whole family to enjoy.
