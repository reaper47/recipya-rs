I am thrilled to present the official website for Recipya! This recipe manager project is focused on simplicity and 
ease of use. It is meant for the whole family to use and enjoy.

You might wonder why I created such application when there are [loads of them](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#recipe-management) 
on the market already. The reason is that none of the solutions satisfied me. They were either too slow, difficult to 
install, had too many features I don't want or need, or the website was not to my liking. There are no recipe managers 
written in my favorite programming language, [Go](https://go.dev), either. So I decided to give it a go 
(no pun intended) and create one of the best recipe manager programs out there. The road ahead will be challenging and 
long because the other solutions are much more mature than the state Recipya is in now. However, I do believe the
effort will pay off.

Thanks to Go, you can rest assured that the software is well-tested, solid, easy to read and maintain, and simple to 
build and install. Development should be straightforward. Please read the [developer guide](/guide/docs/development) 
if you wish to contribute with code.

Today's main goal for the project is to move towards the v1.0.0 milestone. The issues left to complete before 
celebrating the first official release on [GitHub](https://github.com/reaper47/recipya/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av1.0.0).
