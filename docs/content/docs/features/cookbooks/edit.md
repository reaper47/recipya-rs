## Reorder the Recipes

You can reorder the recipes in a cookbook. This is useful when you want its recipes to flow 
in a certain way. For example, you might want all appetizers to appear first, then the lunches, and
finally the dinners.

To reorder them, first open a cookbook. In the following image, we want to switch the position of the
first recipe with that of the last.

Then, drag the page number of the recipe you wish to update. Once at the desired position, 
release the mouse. The pages will be immediately updated.
