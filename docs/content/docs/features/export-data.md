The dropdown is organized into groups. Let's go over them.

## Recipes

You can export your recipes in the following formats.
- JSON
- PDF

The JSON format exports all your recipes in a zipped archive organized hierarchically, with each folder 
containing a JSON file of the recipe. The recipe file follows the [Recipe schema](https://schema.org/Recipe) standard.

The PDF format exports all your recipes in a zipped archive. Each file in the archive follows the naming 
convention `{recipe name}.pdf`.
