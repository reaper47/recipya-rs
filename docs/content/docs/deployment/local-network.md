The project can be self-hosted network-wide over your local network for access from devices other than the computer
you installed the application on.

## Docker

After [installing the Docker](/guide/docs/installation/docker) image, you can access the site network wide at http://<host computer IP>:[<port>](/guide/docs/installation/build/config-file/].

## Release Build

### Linux

Create a service to run the app automatically on boot.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/recipya.service 
```

Copy the following content to the newly-created file.

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Recipya Service
Wants=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/binary/recipya serve
Environment=HOME=/root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Start the service on boot.

```bash
sudo systemctl start recipya.service
sudo systemctl enable recipya.service
```

You can now access the application on your local network at http://<host computer IP>:[<port>](/docs/installation/build/config-file)].

### Windows

The feasibility on Windows remains to be explored.
