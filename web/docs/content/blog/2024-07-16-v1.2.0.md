Phew, what a ride these 4 past months were! Today marks the day when Recipya v1.2.0 is officially released ðŸŽ‰ So, what's new? Many things. Let's go over 
four highlights. 

First, the recipes module now supports tools, keywords and videos. Yes, that's right! You can now attach videos to recipes, and fetched recipes that contain 
embedded videos, e.g. a YouTube video, will display them in the media carousel. 

Second, the [advanced search](/guide/docs/features/recipes/search/). This feature lets you tweak your  search query for the desired results. For example,
let's say your database contains over 200 recipes, and you want to search for all those with `chicken` in the title. In the search bar, you would
type `name:chicken` and tap enter. All recipes with `chicken` in the title will then be displayed.

Third, import support from dozens of recipe manager applications. You may now import recipes from Mealie, Tandoor, Paprika, AccuChef, ChefTap, Crouton, Easy Recipe Deluxe, 
Kalorio, Recipe Keeper, RecipeSage, Saffron. Please consult the [documentation](/guide/docs/features/integrations/) for software-specific instructions. 

Finally, the settings page has been moved to a settings dialog inspired by [Open WebUI's](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui). It looks 
fresh, modern, and well-organized. 

As a bonus, Recipya now has an official mascot, Bananacat the cutie pie!

In addition, plenty of bugs, such as issues with JSON recipe imports, converting and scaling ingredients, data races, and image re-compressions, were thankfully fixed. 
And, most importantly for many, over 100 more websites are now supported! Please read the [release notes](/guide/about/changelog/v1.2.0/) for all the latest goodies.

Something that amazed me is that many people opened one or multiple pull requests for this release. How cool is that! I thank all contributorsâ€” 
[bakker](https://github.com/bakker), [ged](https://github.com/gedw99), [Julian](https://github.com/jesp1999), and [Marcus BlennegÃ¥rd](https://github.com/mblennegard)â€”
for having delved into my codebase, many of whom have never touched Go, and improving what needed to be improved. Keep up the great work guys, and I'm happy that 
you enjoy the software.

You might ask what's coming next in v1.3.0 and beyond. Well, buckle up and check what's planned on the [roadmap](/guide/about/roadmap/) or 
in the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/reaper47/recipya/issues). I'm particularly pumped about improving the measurement system. Please feel free
to open issues if you have ideas on how Recipya can be improved, especially on how generative AI [could be used](https://github.com/reaper47/recipya/issues/397)
could be used. You are welcome to work on some open issues. Don't worry, I don't bite!

Alright, time for me to continue coding and you to start cooking. Catch you later, y'all!
