## Authentication

Users can now log in when the `server.isProduction` key in the configuration file is set to `true` and the `server.url` key's value uses the HTTP protocol.

## Crashes

Users could upload a file or a zip file and the server crashed. It is now handled.

## Docker

A `nightly` Docker image with arm64 support has been added.

## Scraper

### Fixes

The degree symbol has been standardized for temperature conversions.

### Refresh
The scraper module has been refreshed to keep it up-to-date.

### Websites

The `mob.co.uk` website has been removed because the recipe's script tag in the scraped HTML contains invalid JSON.
The `json` and `yaml` libraries unfortunately cannot decode the JSON.

The `nutritionbynathalie.com` website has been removed because it cannot be scraped anymore.

## Recipes

### Categories

Many users would mix keywords with categories. Therefore, a recipe can now have up to one category rather than multiple.

### Database

Fixed a bug where user 2+ would see the recipes of user 1 when accessing the `/` or `/recipes` page.

### Ingredients

Removed the strikethrough when the user checks an ingredient.

### Nutrition per serving

The nutrition facts are now displayed on a per-serving basis when importing a website whose nutritional information is provided per serving rather than per 100g.

Under the hood, the `NutritionSchema.Servings` field must be a number represented as a string. If the field is empty, then the nutrition will be displayed per 100g. Per serving otherwise.
