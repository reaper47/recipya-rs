You might find these shortcuts useful if you are filling the form from your computer.

| Shortcut     | How to enable                     | Result              |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Enter        | Focus on an ingredient text input | Add ingredient row  |
| Ctrl + Enter | Focus on an instruction text area | Add instruction row |

You can also reorder the ingredients and the instructions by dragging the arrow vertically.

### Scan

You can upload an image or a scan of a handwritten or printed recipe to add it to your collection. 
This option is useful for digitizing your and your family's paper recipes.

To do so, click the *Upload* button and select a document on your computer.

- Images (JPEG/JPG, PNG, BMP, HEIF)
- PDF

### Website

You can import any recipe from the supported websites. To do so, click the **Fetch** button, 
paste the recipe's URL or URLs, each on a new line, and click *Submit*. A notification will 
appear when the operation finished. 

Its action button performs an action based on the outcome. When you imported one URL and the 
operation succeeds, the action will redirect you to the recipe. Otherwise, you will be redirected
to the latest report.

To view all supported websites, please click on the <ins>supported</ins> word. You can scrape a 
website not in the supported list, but recipe extraction may fail. Please open an issue on GitHub if
it does.

### Import

You can import recipes in the following formats:
- `.json`: If they adhere to the [Recipe schema](https://schema.org/Recipe) standard
- `.mxp`: Exported recipes from [MasterCook](https://www.mastercook.com)
- `.paprikarecipes`: Exported recipes from [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com) in the `Paprika Recipe Format`
- `.txt`
- `.zip`

![](images/add-recipe-import.webp)

You can upload either a single file or a zip archive containing multiple recipes. The recipes in a zip file may be 
organized by folder. Each folder can contain the recipe's `.json` file. All other files in a folder 
will be ignored during processing.

You may also upload exported recipes from the following applications:
- AccuChef
- ChefTap
- Crouton
- Easy Recipe Deluxe
- Kalorio
- MasterCook
- Paprika
- Recipe Keeper
- RecipeSage
- Saffron

Please refer to the [integrations page](/guide/docs/features/integrations/) for application-specific instructions.

#### Recipya Bookmarklet

The Recipya bookmarklet allows a user to run a JavaScript snippet from their browser that extracts a recipe from a webpage.

It's for websites that both:
- can't be scraped via a server request, i.e. have something like captcha or bot detection
- that have json+ld recipe script snippets on their page

To get the bookmarklet:
1. Access `/recipes/add`
2. Bookmark the `Recipya Bookmarklet` link in the `Import` card.

To use it:
1. Open a recipe webpage, e.g. [double banana nut bread](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/231961/double-banana-nut-bread/)
2. Click the bookmarklet
3. A JSON file is downloaded when it succeeds.

You can then import the extracted recipe from `Add recipe -> Import`.
